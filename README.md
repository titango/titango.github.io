## About

A blog is written using Jekyll which publishes everything including software development, news and things I find interesting.

However, please beware that it's still in development :P

## Theme

This is a modified theme based on [Thomasvaeth's Trophy ](https://github.com/thomasvaeth/trophy-jekyll) theme. Salute to the orginal creator !

Here is what the current changes are:
- The preview image displays the current hovered post's title instead of the static text welcome.
- Insert some *#hashtag* for easy search

**Upcoming features**:
- Add description to preview image together with post's title.
- Add search bar. 🔎
- Able to read a previous post when reading a specific post.
- Comment area on each post. 👥
- Post rating. ⭐️⭐️⭐️
