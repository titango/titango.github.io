One of the book I've read recently is called Programming With Types from Vlad Riscutia published by Manning Publications. <br /> <br />
I happened to purchase a bundle from [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com) a while ago and I thought it was a good time to read it to strengthen my knowledge on Javascript Typescript (as used as examples in the books). <br /><br />
On this section, I will summarize the keys content of the book. I recommend you buy the book to read on for more details.
