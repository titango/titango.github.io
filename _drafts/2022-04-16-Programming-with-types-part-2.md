# Chapter 3: Composition

In previous chapter, we looked at some common primitive types that form the building
blocks of a type system. In this chapter, weâ€™ll look at ways to combine them to
define new types.

The chapter of this book will cover compound types as well as other some common types such as optional types, either types,
and variants, as well as a few applications of these types.

*(This post does not cover everything from the book and will summarize in the easiest way possible. If you are interested in the book, I recommend to purchase them for further reading.)*

### Compound Types

### Expressing either-or with types

### The visitor pattern

### Algebraic data types
